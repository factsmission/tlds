# tlds
A simple templating LD Server

This is mainly a demo to shows how [slds](https://github.com/factsmission/slds) can be extended. It provides a linked data server 
that can return HTML representations of the resource. The HTML rendering is done client-side with [LD2h](https://github.com/rdf2h/ld2h).
